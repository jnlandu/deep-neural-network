# Deep Neural Network from Scratch

In this project, we implement a single layer deep neural network from scratch using python and the basic libraries `numpy` and `matplotlib`. We implement a Python class to define, train,and evaluate the Deep Neural Network for  (binary) classification tasks. We use the Backpropagation algorithm in the class.  This version is a firsr attempt to the implementation of deep neural network. Although, it is worth mentioning that several aspects will be added to the current class to make it more general, notably:
- We will add a separate class `Layer`, that will implement the inputs and the outputs layer, in which we will implement for each layer the forward pass and associates weights, for example **ReLU**, **Leaky ReLU**, etc, instead of only sigmoid.
- etc.
